# Voice pitch controlled Arkanoid game

Play it [here](https://pierd.github.io/voice-arkanoid).

## TODO
- arkanoid - make paddle bounce the ball on an angle
- add more difficulty levels after all blocks are gone (smaller paddle => original paddle size / level)
- try to solve wide noise problem (weighted average?)
